# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

Confident, though I need more practice for fluency

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

semi confident! I need more practice, I couldn't figure out how to make the "or" signs on the keyboard, so I've been copy/pasting

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I'm feeling more confident, but there are so many different ways the if section can be that I'll need more practice

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
this whole assignment took 3 hours. it went over 2 hours more then I estimated.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I think I need to schedule in 30 minutes to an hour of reviewing assignments and how each code functions!

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I have written many questions down, but I feel like the most important thing for me is to get through each assignment successfully then take time each night to review all of the code and how and why it functions the way it does
